I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled 
But it's on the table
The fire is cooking
And they're farming babies
While the slaves are working
Blood is on the table
And the mouths are choking
I'm growing hungry, yeah
I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled
But it's on the table
The fires cooking
And they're farming babies
While the slaves are all working
Blood it's on the table
The mouths are choking
I'm growing hungry (I'm going hungry)
I'm going hungry (I'm going hungry)
I'm going hungry (I'm going hungry yeah)
I'm going hungry (I'm going hungry yeah!)
Oh yeah
Ooh
Yeah! 
Yeah!
I'm going hungry
I'm going hungry! 
I'm going hungry
I'm going hungry! Yeah!
Ooh! 
Ooh yeah! 
Oh yeah! 
Oh!
I don't mind stealing bread! 
Ooh! 
I don't mind stealing bread! 
Yeah!
I'm going hungry
I'm going hungry yeah! 
I'm going hungry
I'm going hungry yeah! 
Ooh!
